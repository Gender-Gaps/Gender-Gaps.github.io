* **Foundational Analysis on the gender profitability gap**
  * In this project, the research team will pursue two related but distinct research efforts, one at the global level and one at the national level in Ethiopia.
* **Gender Data Gaps**
  * This paper highlights the importance of considering the original sampling frame in the secondary use of data for new research. Using data from 43 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, we document a large and robust variation in female-owned enterprise representation between data sources, largely driven by their varied gender-blind sampling frames and protocols. We document important differences in diagnostics of gender gaps and implied policy and research priorities across these data sources with differing sampling protocols (and women-owned enterprise representation). Our analysis suggests a potential gender bias in policies and research reliant on most widely available enterprise data in Sub-Saharan Africa.
